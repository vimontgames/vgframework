# XCodeProjects

This folder contains a number of XCode projects targeted to run on MacOS, respectively iOS or tvOS.
The main purpose of these projects is

1. to illustrate the correct setup of the sharpmake scripts
2. to provide a use-case for XCode-specific features (such as embedding files into an Application Bundle)
3. to showcase a bit of MacOS or IOS functionality
